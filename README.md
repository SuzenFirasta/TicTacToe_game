# üéÆ Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game! This simple yet engaging project is a console-based implementation of the timeless game we all know and love. Whether you're reliving childhood memories or just need a quick break from coding, this game has got you covered!

## üéØ Game Objective

The objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to get three of your marks (either `X` or `O`) in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when a player achieves this, or the grid is completely filled, resulting in a draw.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the program to start the game.
2. **Player Turns**: The game begins with Player `X`. Players take turns entering their move.
3. **Input Move**: Enter the row and column where you want to place your mark. The input should be two integers representing the row and column (both ranging from 0 to 2).
4. **Winning or Drawing**: The game announces a winner if a player successfully places three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If the grid is filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: The game prompts you for your moves and checks if they are valid.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically checks for a win or draw after each move.
- **Turn Switching**: After each valid move, the turn alternates between Player `X` and Player `O`.
- **Simple and Clean UI**: The game board is displayed in a clean, easy-to-read format.
